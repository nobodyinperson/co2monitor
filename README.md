# co2monitor
Automatic data logging for AirCO2ntrol mini USB co2 measurement devices.

**Note**: This application is in development state.

## Background

Hendryk Pl√∂tz reverse-engineered the usb protocol on [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/5301-reverse-engineering-a-low-cost-usb-co-monitor).
I wanted to have an easy-to-use plug'n'play data logging solution for Debian/Ubuntu systems.
That's what **co2monitor** is.

## Debian package

There are ready-to-use debian packages on the [releases page](https://github.com/nobodyinperson/co2monitor/releases), you may download the [latest release](https://github.com/nobodyinperson/co2monitor/releases/latest) there.

To build a debian package from the repository, run ```dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc``` (options mean without signing) from the repository root.
There will be a ```co2monitor_*.deb``` one folder layer above.

## Installation

Install the debian package via ```sudo dpkg -i co2monitor_*.deb```.
Older versions of **co2monitor** will automatically be removed.

Remove **co2monitor** from your system via ```sudo apt-get remove co2monitor```.

## Folder structure

The folder structure (```etc```,```lib```,```usr```,```var```) is based on the [FHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) and will be installed as-is to the target system.
